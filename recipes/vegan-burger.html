    </div>

    <div>
        <p><center>A vegan burger, where you use <strong>vegetal protein</strong> instead of animal protein, is an excellent alternative to the usual burger. We will be following my wife's recipe... sort of.</center></p>

        <p><center>In this recipe we will be using lentils as "meat" for the burger. Lentils are very healthy grains with <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-lentils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost as much protein content as red meat</a> while also being more healthy.</center></p>

        <p><center>Also, our primary objective here is to make the patty, not the actual burger. That part is left to the reader's discretion. Enjoy!</center></p>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food processor</strong></li>

            <li>Oven (optional)</li>

            <li>Assorted recipients and utensils</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><center>Procedure</center></h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the lentils thoroughly to make sure you get rid of whatever contaminant they may have.</li>
            
            <div>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> There are several ways in which you can pre-prepare the lentils. You can just wash them lightly, you can wash them really thoroughly, you can leave them in water for a whole day (to soften them) while also washing them (stagnated lentil water is gross), or you can also <strong>germinate</strong> (or sprout) them.</p>

                <p>Sprouting lentils is as simple as leaving them in water for 1-3 days with proper washes in between. Then you can leave them moist inside the recipient you are using, or inside a colander, for another day. At the end of that day you should see the lentils growing roots, that is what sprouting is. </p>

                <p>Sprouting makes lentils, and grains in general, more nutritious by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sprouted-lentils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutralizing phytic acid and making their nutrients more bioavailable</a>. Phytic acid is a component of plants and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/phytic-acid-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is both a nutrient and anti-nutrient</a>, but is better, overall, to remove it.</p>
            </div>

            <li>Chop the leek, tomato, coriander and garlic real good and mix them.

                <p><em>NOTE:</em> Here you can (<u>if you want</u>) put this mixture into a pan and fry it in a <strong>little</strong> oil. You can add spices to taste to this mixture, but I advise you to keep the spices for a later step.</p>

            </li>

            <li>Put the lentils in the Food processor and process them until they become a paste. Make sure not to overdo it with the processor as we want the paste to still have some bits of lentils (for the crunch factor).</li>

            <li>Mix the processed lentils and the tomato mixture with your utensil of choice in the recipient you want. Make sure to obtain as homogeneous a mixture as you can.</li>
