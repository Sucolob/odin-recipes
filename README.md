# odin-recipes
Assignment for The Odin project where I reinforced my previous knowledge about HTML tags, the
"boiler plate" and formatting, and also remembering how to add repositories to my machine, how
to stage and commit. I will hopefully learn these by memory in the future... Anyway, thanks for
reading, whoever you are.
