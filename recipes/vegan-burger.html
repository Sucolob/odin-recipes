    </div>

    <div>
        <p><center>A vegan burger, where you use <strong>vegetal protein</strong> instead of animal protein, is an excellent alternative to the usual burger. We will be following my wife's recipe... sort of.</center></p>

        <p><center>In this recipe we will be using lentils as "meat" for the burger. Lentils are very healthy grains with <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-lentils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost as much protein content as red meat</a> while also being more healthy.</center></p>

        <p><center>Also, our primary objective here is to make the patty, not the actual burger. That part is left to the reader's discretion. Enjoy!</center></p>

        <h3><center>Equipment</center></h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food processor</strong></li>

            <li>Oven (optional)</li>

            <li>Assorted recipients and utensils</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3><center>Procedure</center></h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the lentils thoroughly to make sure you get rid of whatever contaminant they may have.</li>
            
            <div>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> There are several ways in which you can pre-prepare the lentils. You can just wash them lightly, you can wash them really thoroughly, you can leave them in water for a whole day (to soften them) while also washing them (stagnated lentil water is gross), or you can also <strong>germinate</strong> (or sprout) them.</p>

                <p>Sprouting lentils is as simple as leaving them in water for 1-3 days with proper washes in between. Then you can leave them moist inside the recipient you are using, or inside a colander, for another day. At the end of that day you should see the lentils growing roots, that is what sprouting is. </p>

                <p>Sprouting makes lentils, and grains in general, more nutritious by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sprouted-lentils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutralizing phytic acid and making their nutrients more bioavailable</a>. Phytic acid is a component of plants and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/phytic-acid-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is both a nutrient and anti-nutrient</a>, but is better, overall, to remove it.</p>
            </div><br>

            <li>Chop the leek, tomato, coriander and garlic real good and mix them. Wash them first!
                
                <div>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> Here you can (<u>if you want</u>) put this mixture into a pan and fry it in a <strong>little</strong> oil. You can add spices to taste to this mixture, but I advise you to keep the spices for a later step.</p>
            </div>

            </li><br>

            <li>Put the lentils in the Food processor and process them until they become a paste. Make sure not to overdo it with the processor as we want the paste to still have some bits of lentils (for the crunch factor).</li><br>

            <li>Mix the processed lentils and the tomato mixture with your utensil of choice in the recipient you want. Try to obtain as homogeneous a mixture as you can.</li><br>            

            <li>Add the wheat bran to the mixture and mix thoroughly.</li><br>

            <li>Prepare a non-stick oven tray or a regular tray with baking paper on which to put the burgers.</li><br>

            <li>Form the burgers in whatever shape and using whatever instrument you want. If the mixture is too dry or crumbles then you might want to add a little more water or oil.

                <p><em>NOTE:</em> You want the consistency of the patty to be enough so that it stays together in your hand. Remember we are not using eggs or flour so it may feel very fragile.</p>
            </li><br>

            <li>Put the burgers on the tray (or the baking paper) and put the tray inside the oven.</li>

            <div>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> The oven should be pre-heated for 10 minutes at max temperature and then put at 180 C (350 F) for the rest of the baking.</p>

                <p><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> You can smear some oil with a brush on each burger to make it more crunchy, this will, however, retract from the health factor.</p>
            </div><br>

            <li>Leave the burgers in the oven for 40-60 min, or until you see them a nice brown color. You can try them constantly to see if they reached a point you want them in. Remember these don't have that much water so they can get dry and hard easily.</li><br>

            <li>Take the burgers out of the oven and serve as you desire. Enjoy!</li>

        </ol><br>

    <h3><center>Final notes on recipe</center></h3>

    <p>There are several other ways in which lentils can be prepared to make the burgers.</p>
    
    <p>One of them is to cook them beforehand with water, as you would normally do. You would want them to be very soft and mushy. Then you take them and flatten them into a burger shape, with the other ingredients. Following this method, however, implies you will need a bonding agent, which would normally be eggs, so it is no longer a vegan recipe.</p>

    <p>Well, that's it. Bon appettit!</p>
